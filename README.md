# My machine provisioning
Playbook that provisions my workstation with one command.

Execute this command on the machine which you want to provision and that's it!

```
wget -qO- https://github.com/miciek/my-machine-provisioning/raw/master/provision.sh | bash
```

The playbook uses configuration files from another repository: [dotfiles](https://github.com/miciek/dotfiles).
